# Enhanced Versions - Reference Documentation

This directory contains the **comprehensive, detailed** versions of the black box architecture prompts with extensive examples and explanations.

## üìÅ Files in This Directory

### Enhanced Prompts (~63 KB total)

- **`refactor.md`** (~17 KB) - Comprehensive refactoring guide with multi-language examples
- **`plan.md`** (~20 KB) - Complete architecture planning methodology
- **`debug.md`** (~26 KB) - Detailed debugging and testing strategies

### Documentation

- **`VERSIONS.md`** - Quick reference guide comparing compact and enhanced versions

## üéØ When to Use Enhanced vs. Compact

### Use Enhanced (these files) when:
- ‚úÖ Learning the methodology for the first time
- ‚úÖ Need detailed code examples in multiple languages (Python, TS, Go, Rust, Java)
- ‚úÖ Want comprehensive explanations of principles
- ‚úÖ Creating training material or documentation
- ‚úÖ Doing one-time deep architectural analysis
- ‚úÖ Need extensive before/after examples

### Use Compact (in `../commands/` and `../skill/`) when:
- ‚úÖ Creating slash commands
- ‚úÖ Frequent usage
- ‚úÖ Token efficiency is critical
- ‚úÖ You already understand the principles
- ‚úÖ Production development work

## üìä Size Comparison

| Version | Files | Total Size | Token Count | Best For |
|---------|-------|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Compact** | `../commands/`, `../skill/` | ~18 KB | ~3,300 tokens | Commands, daily use |
| **Enhanced** | This directory | ~63 KB | ~12,000 tokens | Reference, learning |

**Enhanced is ~3.5x larger** but provides:
- 10+ code examples per language
- Step-by-step tutorials
- Detailed pattern explanations
- Comprehensive testing strategies
- Educational deep-dives

## üîç What's Included in Enhanced

### 1. Multi-Language Code Examples

Each prompt includes extensive examples in:
- Python (class-based and functional)
- TypeScript (React components, APIs)
- Go (interface-driven design)
- Rust (trait-based patterns)
- Java (enterprise patterns)

### 2. Before/After Transformations

Detailed refactoring examples showing:
- Current state (coupled code)
- Analysis of problems
- Proposed black box design
- Final implementation
- Testing strategies

### 3. Educational Content

- Philosophy explanations
- Risk assessment frameworks
- Team organization advice
- Architecture decision records
- Success metrics definitions

### 4. Comprehensive Protocols

- Phase-by-phase workflows
- Mandatory output templates
- Quality validation checklists
- Debugging methodologies
- Testing patterns

## üìñ Recommended Usage

### For New Users

1. **Start here** - Read one enhanced prompt fully
2. **Understand principles** - See VERSIONS.md for version comparison
3. **Practice with compact** - Use `../commands/` for actual work
4. **Reference back** - Return to enhanced when you need detailed examples

### For Experienced Users

1. **Use compact** - For daily development work
2. **Reference enhanced** - When you encounter edge cases
3. **Share enhanced** - For onboarding new team members

## üöÄ Using Enhanced Prompts

### Manual Paste (Best Method)

```bash
# Copy the content of an enhanced prompt
cat enhanced/refactor.md

# Paste into Claude/Cursor when you need comprehensive guidance
```
